# Webscraping Challenge
## Background
In this challenge, I'm taking on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I have learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identified their id and class attributes, and used this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

As I worked on this challenge, I also strengthened the same core skills that I have developed until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights.

## Deliverables
This challenge consisted of two technical products. I submitted the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
